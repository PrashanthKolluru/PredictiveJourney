# 📝 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project leverages **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to uncover distinct customer groups from behavioral data. By applying **K-Means Clustering**, we identify meaningful customer segments that help drive targeted marketing and improve business strategies.

## 📊 Process Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Import & Exploration
- Loaded customer data for segmentation analysis.
- Explored dataset structure and basic statistics to understand feature distributions.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Verified data integrity by checking for missing values and inconsistencies.
- Selected relevant numerical features for clustering.

### 3️⃣ Clustering with K-Means
- Used **K-Means Clustering** from **scikit-learn**.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- Applied **KMeans with 5 clusters (`n_clusters=5`)** to segment the customers.
- Assigned cluster labels for further analysis.

### 4️⃣ Visualization & Interpretation
- Visualized customer segments using scatter plots.
- Analyzed each cluster’s characteristics to define customer profiles.
- Interpreted the clusters based on behavioral patterns and spending habits.

### 🟢 Cluster 0: High Spending, Low to Mid Income
- **Annual Income:** Low to Medium range.
- **Spending Score:** Very High.
- **Insight:** Value-seeking customers with high engagement. Best suited for promotions, rewards programs, and personalized deals.

### 🔴 Cluster 1: Average Income, Average Spending
- **Annual Income:** Medium.
- **Spending Score:** Moderate.
- **Insight:** Typical customers with balanced income and spending. Potential for upselling or cross-selling.

### 🔵 Cluster 2: High Income, High Spending
- **Annual Income:** High.
- **Spending Score:** High.
- **Insight:** Premium segment with strong purchasing power. Target with VIP programs and premium offerings.

### 🟣 Cluster 3: Low Income, Low Spending
- **Annual Income:** Low.
- **Spending Score:** Low.
- **Insight:** Price-sensitive customers. Engage with discounts, entry-level products, and affordability-focused campaigns.

### 🟦 Cluster 4: High Income, Low Spending
- **Annual Income:** High.
- **Spending Score:** Low.
- **Insight:** Affluent but cautious spenders. Focus on quality, exclusivity, and long-term value in campaigns.

### 📊 Summary Table

| Cluster | Income Level | Spending Behavior | Key Strategy |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 🟢 Cluster 0 | Low to Mid | High Spending | Promotions, Loyalty Programs |
