# **High School Student Performance Prediction**

**_Description:_**
This project focuses on predicting high school student grades using a regression model, based on a dataset containing performance metrics of students from Montreal.
The primary objectives were to explore feature selection techniques, build robust regression models, and evaluate their performance to derive actionable insights.

**_Contents of the Repository:_**
- PowerPoint Presentation: Detailed explanation of methods, models, results, and conclusions, along with key plots and insights.
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Includes the data preprocessing, feature selection, regression model implementation, and evaluation.
- HTML Export of Notebook: A web-friendly version of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing.

**_Highlights_:**
- Feature Selection: Techniques were applied to identify the most relevant predictors of student performance.
- Regression Models: Various regression models were tested to optimize grade predictions.
- Visualization: Clear, concise plots to demonstrate results and highlight key trends in the data.
